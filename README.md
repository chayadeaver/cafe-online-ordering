## Installation

## Usage

To use the app, you would need to create an account using your name, email, and password. Once an account is created, you will be taken to a page that displays all your orders. If there are no orders, you will be given a link to create one. After selecting to create an order, you will be taken to an order form. After selecting the items to add to order and submitting the order, you will be taken to the page that shows the items in the order you created. From here, you can edit your order, delete items off order, and add other items to your order. Once your order is updated, you will be taken back to the current order page. From the current order page, you can delete your order.
